Project Name

Alchemilla 
A Java Based House-Plant Care Scheduling Desktop Application

Product Description

	Alchemilla is a home plant-care scheduling solution designed to simplify the daunting but rewarding act of caring for plants at home. Aspiring growers will be able to upload information about house plants, or to use the program to find information about houseplants. They can then organize this information by selecting plants they wish to care for, and the program will generate a care schedule. This schedule can then be exported to a common calendar application such as Outlook Calendar. The name Alchemilla was chosen because this plant is sometimes referred to as the 'Forget-Me-Not'. The purpose of this application is to assist plant care enthusiasts in simplifying the management of their care routines, ensuring they never forget to water another plant. Upon completing a scheduling and adding it to their calendar, aspiring growers can rest assured they will have all of the information they need to competently care for their plants.
