This code contains a demonstration of a very simple GUI application
based on Java Swing. The demonstration pulls from a tutorial that implements
menus. It has been modified to also display a JPEG image in the content
pane. There is one class, and this class contains a main. 

Compile and run with Java 15. Configure the compiler such that main is 
found in the plant.MenuLayoutDemo class. 

The image painted to the content pain can be found in the root directory of
the project.
